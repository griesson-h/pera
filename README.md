# pera
my failed attempt to create a text editor in raylib (maybe ill do with this something in the future)
# installation
## linux
```bash
# Arch (and arch-based) Linux
sudo pacman -Sy --needed git go

# Debian (and debian based)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git golang-go

git clone https://github.com/griesson-h/pera.git
cd pera
go build
```
## Windows
I highly recommend praying to God throughout the Windows installation process
```bash
winget install Git.Git Golang.Go # reboot may be required
wget https://github.com/Vuniverse0/mingwInstaller/releases/download/1.2.1/mingwInstaller.exe
mingwInstaller.exe
# follow the installation process
git clone https://github.com/griesson-h/pera.git
cd pera
go build
```
